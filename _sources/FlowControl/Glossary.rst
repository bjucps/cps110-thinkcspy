.. glossary::

    block
        A group of consecutive statements with the same indentation.

    body
        The block of statements in a compound statement that follows the
        header.

    branch
        One of the possible paths of the flow of execution determined by
        conditional execution.

    chained conditional
        A conditional branch with more than two possible flows of execution. In
        Python chained conditionals are written with ``if ... elif ... else``
        statements.

    comparison operator
        One of the operators that compares two values: ``==``, ``!=``, ``>``,
        ``<``, ``>=``, and ``<=``.

    condition
        The boolean expression in a conditional statement that determines which
        branch is executed.

    conditional statement
        A statement that controls the flow of execution depending on some
        condition. In Python the keywords ``if``, ``elif``, and ``else`` are
        used for conditional statements.

    control flow
        See *flow of execution* in the chapter on Functions.

    deterministic
		A process that is repeatable and predictable.

    documentation
	    A place where you can go to get detailed information about aspects of your
	    programming language.

    iteration
		A basic building block for algorithms (programs).  It allows steps to be repeated.  Sometimes called *looping*.

    loop body
        Any number of statements nested inside a loop. The nesting is indicated
        by the fact that the statements are indented under the for loop
        statement.

    loop variable
        A variable used as part of a for loop. It is assigned a different value
        on each iteration of the loop, and is used as part of the terminating
        condition of the loop,
        when it can no longer get a further value.

    range
        A built-in function in Python for generating sequences of integers.  It
        is especially useful when we need to write a for loop that executes a
        fixed number of times.

    sequential
		The default behavior of a program.  Step by step processing of algorithm.
