Introduction to Python Modules
------------------------------

One of the best things about the Python programming language is the ecosystem that surrounds it.  This chapter introduces you to some of the amazing packages that allow you to solve real world problems without starting from scratch.

As you may have gathered, Python provides us the ability to use modules to do everything from sending emails to image
processing to complex machine learning.  But, even though Python gives us a tremendous amount of power from these
modules you still need to know the python basics in order to glue everything together.  We will explore
modules used to perform math, generate random numbers, and draw graphics using the metaphor of a virtual turtle.

Learning Goals
==============

* Understand that Python is extensible through modules
* Understand the concepts of classes, objects, instances, attributes, and methods

Objectives
==========

* To import an entire module
* To import a single function from a module
* Write programs using the turtle framework
