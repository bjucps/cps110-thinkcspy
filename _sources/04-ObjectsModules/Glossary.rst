Glossary

.. glossary::

    attribute
        Some state or value that belongs to a particular object.  For example,
        tess has a color.

    canvas
        A surface within a window where drawing takes place.

    for loop
        A statement in Python for convenient repetition of statements in
        the *body* of the loop.

    instance
        An object that belongs to a class.  `tess` and `alex` are different
        instances of the class `Turtle`

    invoke
        An object has methods.  We use the verb invoke to mean *activate the
        method*.  Invoking a method is done by putting parentheses after the
        method name, with some possible arguments.  So  ``wn.exitonclick()`` is
        an invocation of the ``exitonclick`` method.

    method
        A function that is attached to an object.  Invoking or activating the
        method causes the object to respond in some way, e.g. ``forward`` is
        the method when we say ``tess.forward(100)``.

    module
        A file containing Python definitions and statements intended for use in
        other Python programs. The contents of a module are made available to
        the other program by using the *import* statement.

    object
        A "thing" to which a variable can refer.  This could be a screen window,
        or one of the turtles you have created.

    pseudo-random number
		A number that is not genuinely random but is instead created algorithmically.

    random number
		A number that is generated in such a way as to exhibit statistical randomness.

    random number generator
		A function that will provide you with random numbers, usually between 0 and 1.

    state
		The collection of attribute values that a specific data object maintains.

    terminating condition
        A condition that occurs which causes a loop to stop repeating its body.
        In the ``for`` loops we saw in this chapter, the terminating condition
        has been when there are no more elements to assign to the loop variable.

    turtle
		A data object used to create pictures (known as turtle graphics).
