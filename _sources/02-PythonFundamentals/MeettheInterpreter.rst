Python Math
^^^^^^^^^^^

As demonstrated in the video, you can use Python to perform mathematical computations by entering math expressions
involving operators and operands into the Python shell. **Operators** are symbols that perform computations like
addition, multiplication and division. The values the operator works on are called **operands**.

==========  =========== 
Operator    Description
==========  =========== 
``+``       Addition
``-``       Subtraction
``*``       Multiplication
``/``       Division (``float`` result)
``//``      Division (``int`` result)
``%``       Modulus / Remainder
``**``      Exponentiation
==========  ===========

The operators ``+`` and ``-``, and the use of parenthesis for grouping, mean in Python what they mean in mathematics.
The asterisk (``*``) is the operator for multiplication, slash (``/``) is the usual operator for division, and ``**`` is
the operator for exponentiation. There are two operators for division (more on that in a moment). Addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, and exponentiation all do what you expect. The modulus operator (``%``) computes the remainder of
an integer division; we'll discuss it later in this chapter. 

We call a mathematical computation like ``5 + 3 * 26`` an **expression**. An expression is a combination of operators and
operands that produces a value. Python **evaluates** expressions to compute values. When you type an expression into the
Python shell, the shell evaluates the expression by performing the specified operations on the operand values. The
evaluation results in a single value, which is displayed by the shell. For example, the following shows how the shell
evaluates the expression ``2 ** 3`` by computing 2\ :sup:`3`, producing the value 8:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> 2 ** 3
    8
    >>>

The following are all legal Python expressions::

    20 + 32.5
    2 ** 3
    -25 * 60 / 13
    (2 * (5 + 9)) * (15 - 7)

Try starting the Python shell on your computer and typing them in to see Python compute their values.

.. note::
    I demonstrate how to start the Python shell on a Windows 10 computer in the video at the top of this page.
    
    .. TODO: Demonstrate how to start it on a Mac

If you ask Python to ``print`` an expression, the interpreter **evaluates** the expression and displays the result.
Execute the following example and see if the results match what you think they should.

.. activecode:: ch02_15
    :nocanvas:

    print(2 + 3)
    print(2 - 3)
    print(2 * 3)
    print(2 ** 3)
    print(3 ** 2)

Expressions must be correctly formed in order for Python to be able to evaluate them. Try deleting one of the 3's from the
example above and note the error that occurs when you attempt to run the faulty program.

.. index::
   division /  //  

Division
^^^^^^^^

Unlike many computer languages, Python provides two operators for division: ``/`` and ``//``. To understand
the difference between them, execute this example:

.. activecode:: meetint_div
    :nocanvas: 

    print(8 / 3)
    print(8 // 3)

The expression ``8 / 3`` yields a number with a fractional amount (approximately ``2.7``), and the expression ``8 // 3``
yields an integer (``2``). Both the ``/`` and the ``//`` operators perform a division. The difference is that
the integer division operator ``//`` performs a division, and then yields an integer result. 
Notice that ``/`` does not round the result to the nearest integer; it drops (or *truncates*) the
fractional portion, leaving just the integer result. 

Now, take a look at the following example:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> 8 / 2
    4.0
    >>> 8 // 2
    4
    >>>

This is interesting! The result of dividing 8 by 2 is an integer (``4``). However, the result is expressed differently,
depending on which form of the division operator is used. Keep reading to explore this difference in more depth.

Integer and Floating-Point Calculations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's look at another example, this time with a different operator:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> 2.5 + 2
    4.5
    >>> 2 + 2
    4
    >>> 2.0 + 2.0
    4.0
    >>> 2.0 + 2
    4.0
    >>>

The results of the first two calculations in this example probably come as no surprise. The final calculation is more
interesting, because it demonstrates how Python differentiates between two types of numbers: integers (ex. ``2``), also
called **ints**, and floating-point numbers (ex. ``2.5`` and ``2.0``), also called *floats*. In standard mathematics, there
is no difference between the values ``2`` and ``2.0``. Both represent the same value. However, in Python, the values
``2`` and ``2.0`` are different. They are stored differently internally, and have different capabilities, as we'll see shortly.

In Python, calculations involving only integers always yield an integer result (as long as you stick with integer division).
Calculations involving only floats, or a mixture of floats and integers, always yield a float result. Here are some more
examples to illustrate this point. Look at the examples carefully and take a moment with each to see if you can explain
why each result turned out the way it did:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> 1 + 2 * 3
    7
    >>> 1 + 2.0 * 3
    7.0
    >>> 5 // 2
    2
    >>> 5.0 // 2
    2.0
    >>>

The last example is particularly interesting. Perhaps you would have expected the integer division operator to produce
the result ``2``. Here's what happened. The ``//`` operator divided 5 by 2, and then dropped the fractional portion, yielding
the integer 2. However, since the calculation involves a mixture of floats and integers, the result was expressed as a float, not
an int. 

If you found that a little tricky to follow, that's understandable. However, it's important that you grasp that Python
uses very precise rules to determine the outcome of mathematical computations. The rules make sense, once you understand them,
but occasionally the results can surprise you.

Now, let's discuss an important difference between integer and floating-point calculations in Python. Calculations involving
only integers can yield results with extremely high precision. However, calculations involving floating-point numbers
are much more limited in their precision. Try executing the following program:

.. activecode:: meetint_intfloat
    :nocanvas: 

    print(20000 + 1)
    print(20000.0 + 1)
    print(2000000000000000000000 + 1)
    print(2000000000000000000000.0 + 1)

As you can see, both integer calculations produced a completely precise result. However, the second floating
point calculation could not represent the complete result; Python expressed it in scientific notation as 2e+21 
(2 Ã— 10\ :sup:`21`), which is an approximation of the correct result.

So, if you're operating on large numbers and need high amounts of precision, it's important to perform integer
calculations using integer values when possible. Introducing even one float into your calculation causes Python to
switch from integer processing to floating point calculations, which can result in a significant loss of precision. For
the types of programs you will be writing in this course, you won't need highly precise calculations. I'm really
pointing this out to highlight the fact that the difference between integer and floating point data is significant.

.. index::
   argument
   function
   round

Rounding
^^^^^^^^

Recall that integer division operator drops the fractional portion of the result, and does not round. Suppose that you
want the result *rounded* to the nearest integer instead. To do that, you must use the ``round`` function, like this:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> round(8 / 3)
    3
    >>>

``round`` is a function that rounds its argument to the nearest integer. A **function** performs a computation on a 
value that you supply in parenthesis, called the **argument**. In this example, the argument is the value that results
from the calculation ``8 / 3``. You could also supply a literal value as the argument to ``round```, like this:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> round(2.666665)
    3
    >>>

Here, the argument is the literal value ``2.666665``. 

Functions are similar to the concept of operators that we covered at the beginning of this section. Both perform a
computation on data. One difference between them is that operators are typically special symbols written in between the
values they operate on, while functions are named and operate on values supplied in parenthesis. (However, you'll
eventually meet the boolean operators, which are named.) Another difference involves language extensibility. Operators
are usually built in to the language, and you usually can't add new ones. In contrast, while Python provides several
built-in functions, it also allows programmers to extend the language by creating new ones.

We'll explore functions in much more depth in a later chapter in this book. For now, note that Python
provides many built-in functions that you can use in your programs to manipulate data in various ways. Later in this
chapter, you will meet more built-in functions.

Key Terms
^^^^^^^^^

We've covered a lot of ground in this section! I suggest that you take a moment to review some of the key terms that
have been introduced, including **operator**, **operand**, **expression**, **evaluate**, **function**, **argument**,
**int**, and **float**. There's a short :ref:`glossary <fundamentals-glossary>` at the end of this chapter to aid your review.
