Hello Little Turtles!
=====================

.. index::
    single: module


There are many *modules* in Python that provide very powerful features that we can use in our own programs.  Some of
these can send email or fetch web pages. Others allow us to perform complex mathematical calculations. We'll discuss the
idea of a module in more depth in the next chapter, but in this chapter we will use the turtle module introduced
in the first chapter to teach you additional concepts about object-oriented programming.

.. note::

	The turtles are fun, but the real purpose of the chapter is to teach ourselves
	a little more Python and to develop our theme of *computational thinking*,
	or *thinking like a computer scientist*.  Most of the Python covered here will
	be explored in more depth later.
